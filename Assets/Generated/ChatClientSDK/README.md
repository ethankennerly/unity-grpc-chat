# ChatClientSDK (Generated)

This folder is **generated** by `Backend/scripts/sync-unity-client-sdk.sh`.

- Do **not** edit files here by hand; changes will be overwritten.
- Only plain C# runtime sources are copied (no bin/obj/DLLs/CSProj/SLN/Roslyn .g.cs).
- If you need to regenerate, run the sync script again.
